author: Matt Green - @mgreen27
description: | 
   This is an artifact to detect and assist scoping of observed exploitation of 
   Cleo file transfer software.
   
   CVE-2024-50623 and a possible new CVE has been associated with this activity.
   
   The artifact enables detection via:
   
   - Disk: Parsing known XML filenames and Log XML files
   - USNJ: Searching for known autorun and log file activity.
   - Yara: Java backdoor in memory and logs
