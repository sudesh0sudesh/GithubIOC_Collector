*UPDATE 20NOV2017* 

Added "psfamid.py" which is a small script where I converted the original regex queries/logic for family identification/matching into something that could be run adhoc. Either supply a file or base64 encoded string and it will attempt to match certain indicators to known families. 

This script is not maintained but just provided for additional insight if interested.
