      "description": "Unit 42 researchers have discovered a new variant of eCh0raix/QNAPCrypt ransomware targeting Synology network-attached storage (NAS) and Quality Network Appliance Provider (QNAP) NAS devices. To achieve this, attackers are also leveraging CVE-2021-28799 to deliver the new eCh0raix ransomware variant to QNAP devices. While eCh0raix is a known ransomware that has historically targeted QNAP and Synology NAS devices in separate campaigns, this new variant is the first time we\u2019ve seen it combining functionality to target both QNAP and Synology NAS devices, demonstrating that some ransomware developers are continuing to invest in optimizing the tools used to target devices common in the small office and home office (SOHO).",

      "description": "To disguise the source of malicious traffic, adversaries may chain together multiple proxies. Typically, a defender will be able to identify the last proxy traffic traversed before it enters their network; the defender may or may not be able to identify any previous proxies before the last-hop proxy. This technique makes identifying the original source of the malicious traffic even more difficult by requiring the defender to trace malicious traffic through several proxies to identify its source. A particular variant of this behavior is to use onion routing networks, such as the publicly available TOR network. (Citation: Onion Routing)\n\nIn the case of network infrastructure, particularly routers, it is possible for an adversary to leverage multiple compromised devices to create a multi-hop proxy chain within the Wide-Area Network (WAN) of the enterprise.  By leveraging [Patch System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/001), adversaries can add custom code to the affected network devices that will implement onion routing between those nodes.  This custom onion routing network will transport the encrypted C2 traffic through the compromised population, allowing adversaries to communicate with any device within the onion routing network.  This method is dependent upon the [Network Boundary Bridging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1599) method in order to allow the adversaries to cross the protected network boundary of the Internet perimeter and into the organization\u2019s WAN. Protocols such as ICMP may be used as a transport.",
