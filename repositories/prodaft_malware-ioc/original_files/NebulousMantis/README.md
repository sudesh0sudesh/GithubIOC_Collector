# Inside the Latest Espionage Campaign of Nebulous Mantis

Nebulous Mantis (a.k.a. Cuba, STORM-0978, Tropical Scorpius, UNC2596) is a Russian-speaking cyber espionage group that has actively deployed the RomCom remote access trojan (RAT) and Hancitor loader in targeted campaigns since mid-2019. Operating with geopolitical motives, the group primarily focuses on critical infrastructure, government agencies, political leaders, and NATO related defense organizations. They use spear-phishing emails with weaponized document links to deliver RomCom for espionage, lateral movement, and data theft. Nebulous Mantis has been using the sophisticated RomCom since around mid-2022. This RAT is primarily employed for espionage and ransomware activities. The malware employs advanced evasion techniques, including living-off-the-land (LOTL) tactics and encrypted command and control (C2) communications, while continuously evolving its infrastructureâ€”leveraging bulletproof hosting to maintain persistence and evade detection. The Nebulous Mantis team, which changes the domains they use every month, obtains these spear-phishing and C2 servers from LuxHost and AEZA bulletproof hosting (BPH) services. Analysis of the team's infrastructures shows that LARVA-290, the individual who obtained intrusion servers for and conducted numerous ransomware attacks, continues to play a critical IT admin role within the Nebulous Mantis team and in RomCom attacks. The Nebulous Mantis group's attacks using RomCom involve data exfiltration from systems and system encryption using various ransomware. We are assessing with moderate confidence that the group's goal is to carry out espionage, despite evidence suggesting involvement in data exfiltration for ransomware and double extortion.
