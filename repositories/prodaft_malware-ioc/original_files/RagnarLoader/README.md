# Ragnar Loader Indicators of Compromise (IOC)

Ragnar Loader, also known as Sardonic, is a sophisticated toolkit of the Monstrous Mantis (a.k.a. Ragnar Locker) ransomware group, which has been inflicting targeted cyberattacks on organizations since its emergence in 2020. Ragnar Loader often referred to as the Ragnar Framework by its affiliatesâ€”plays an essential role by establishing persistent access to compromised systems and ensuring long-term fixation. This loader not only facilitates the initial breach but also lays the groundwork for further network takeover and control.
