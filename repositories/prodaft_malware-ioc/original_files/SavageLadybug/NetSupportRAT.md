Savage Ladybug (a.k.a. FIN7), a well-known cybercrime group, is utilizing malicious Google ads to distribute NetSupport RAT, a remote access tool that allows attackers to control victim systems covertly.

The PRODAFT Threat Intelligence team's latest research shows that the group still uses same techniques to spread their ransomware campaigns.
