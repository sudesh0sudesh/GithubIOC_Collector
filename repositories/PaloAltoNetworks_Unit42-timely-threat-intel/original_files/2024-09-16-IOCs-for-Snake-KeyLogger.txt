INFECTION CHAIN:

- email --> attached archive --> extracted EXE --> victim double-clicks EXE on vulnerable host --> Snake KeyLogger infection

NOTES:

- The emails used for data exfiltration in this infection show "VIP Recovery" as the name.
- This has also been identified as "VIP KeyLogger."
- But based on a test message in the email account used for data exfiltration, this appears to be Snake KeyLogger.
- This Snake KeyLogger sample is a .NET-based Windows EXE.
- We've seen .NET-based Windows EXE files before with AgentTesla and its successors like OriginLogger.
- In recent months, Snake KeyLogger has been commonly found in the wild, much like AgentTesla and OriginLogger have been.
- This infection exfiltrated login credentials from the lab host's web browsers and Microsoft Outlook.
- This infection also exfiltrated cookie data from the lab host's web browsers.
