SUMMARY:

- In the past 3 months, we've observed a campaign with an infrastructure likely used by an affiliate of Dark Scorpius (the Black Basta ransomware group).
- We have identified 20 IP addresses associated with this attack infrastructure.

DETAILS: 

- Since October 2024, we've observed several instances of "email bombing" against different organizations in this campaign.
- Email bombing is a denial of service attack that floods a target's inbox with emails. 
- Email bombing is generally used to potentially hide security alerts or other notifications.
- However, these attacks use email bombing to create an IT issue by making targeted email clients unusable.
- After email bombing, attackers initiate a Microsoft Teams chat session pretending to be the victim's help desk or IT department.
- Offering to fix the email problem, attackers instruct victims to install a remote management tool like Microsoft Quick Assist.
- If successful, attackers download a zip archive to the targeted host and extract its contents using Tar for Windows.
- The zip archive contains a copy of Microsoft's Onedrive Standalone Updater, Onedrivestandaloneupdater.exe, and other files that include a malicious DLL named winhttp.dll.
- In an example of DLL side loading, Onedrivestandaloneupdater.exe loads the malicious file named winhttp.dll.
- This malware potentially beacons out to multiple C2 IP addresses.
- We have also observed an added registry key at HKCU\SOFTWARE\TitanPlus storing these C2 IP addresses.
- In at least one instance, this activity led to the deployment of Black Basta ransomware.
