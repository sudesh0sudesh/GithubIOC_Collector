NOTES:

- In recent weeks, we've seen multiple newly-registered domains with the string "cybercab" or "robotaxi" in the domain names.
- These domains are hosting sites for cryptocurrency investment scams.
- These scams are likely exploiting interest in the release of Teslaâ€™s robotaxi Cybercab.

LIST OF DOMAINS USED FOR THE SCAM:

- cybercab[.]icu
- robotaxi2024[.]xyz
- robotaxioneth[.]com
