NOTES:

- As recently as 2024-08-27, fake verification pages have been established to distribute Lumma Stealer malware.
- These pages have a button that, when clicked, shows instructions for victims to paste PowerShell script into a Run window.
- This copy/paste PowerShell script retrieves and runs a Windows EXE for Lumma Stealer malware.
- The associated Lumma Stealer EXE files retrieve and use zip archives that don't appear to be inherently malicious on their own.
- This is somewhat similar to activity that we reported in June 2024 at:
