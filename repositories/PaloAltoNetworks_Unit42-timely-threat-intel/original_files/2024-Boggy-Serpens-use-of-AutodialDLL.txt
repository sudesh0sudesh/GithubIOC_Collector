INITIAL NOTES:

- Boggy Serpens is the name we use to track a state-sponsored Iranian threat actor also known as MuddyWater or TA450.
- This is the first time we've discovered Boggy Serpens abusing the Windows Registry's AutodialDLL function. 
- This Boggy Serpens activity appears to be based on an attack method documented by the Atomic Red Team at:
  https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/T1546/T1546.md#atomic-test-1---persistence-with-custom-autodialdll
- Although we detected the file hash for the C2 framework sample, we unfortunately could not obtain a copy of it to share.

NOTABLE DISCOVERY:

- The AutodialDLL technique has been used for persistence in the wild by other threat actors.
- But in this case, Boggy Serpens is AutodialDLL to side-load the malicious DLL but relying on a scheduled task for persistence.

PERSISTENCE DETAILS:

- Persistence established through a scheduled task.
- The scheduled task uses PowerShell commands to abuse the AutodialDLL technique.
- PowerShell commands first update the AutodialDLL value in the Windows Registry, setting it to the malicious DLL.
- PowerShell commands then side-load the malicious DLL by opening a hidden Internet Explorer window.
- PowerShell commands finally reset the AutodialDLL value to its default settings to avoid other processes side-loading the DLL again.
- The process repeats the next time the scheduled task runs.

TIMEFRAME OF THE ACTIVITY: 

- January 2024
