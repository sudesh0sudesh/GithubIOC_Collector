NOTES:

- Fake shopping campaigns are prevalent scams that mimic legitimate e-commerce sites.
- These fraudulent sites often have limited payment options and favor cryptocurrencies to enable easier theft.
- Indicators of fake shopping sites include broken links, unbelievably enticing deals, and poor-quality content.
- These sites often feature "dropcaught" domains, which are expired and re-registered domains, due to their history and residual traffic.
- We've identified 18 malicious domains with similar names, hosted on suspicious infrastructure, all hosting "Penguin Mall" fake e-commerce sites.
- Attackers re-registered a dropcaught domain penguinshops[.]com, originally a legitimate shopping site, on 2024-09-30.
- WHOIS records reveal 2 registrants for 17 additional domains on 2024-09-30 and 2024-10-05 related to this campaign.
- These sites offer BTC, ETH and USDT cryptocurrency as their only payment options.
- Potential victims send cryptocurrency to the these sites wallet addresses.
- Victims can also request loan applications requiring sensitive info such as passport number and scanned copies of passports.
- These sites include links for Android and iOS apps for victims to help facilitate the scam.
- If viewed on a desktop OS, app download pages from these sites display a QR code for mobile apps to scan.
- If viewed on a mobile device, the app download pages display links to download Android or iOS files.
- Investigation revealed strong associations between the domains, as they share hosting IP addresses and cross-link to each other.
