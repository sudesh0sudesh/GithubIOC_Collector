NOTES: 

- Threat actors exploit public attention in the Olympic Games by creating domains that seem related to the event.
- We recently observed a surge in network abuse from Olympic-themed newly registered domains (NRDs).
- For a specific example, this page lists some Olympic-themed domains used for Chinese gambling sites.
