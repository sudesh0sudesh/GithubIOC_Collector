- This creates messages in a web browser instructing victims to paste script into a PowerShell window.
- We are currently seeing Lumma Stealer malware pushed by these "ClickFix" popups.
- A similar infection chain dubbed "ClearFake" is also active using this technique, possibly sending different malware.
