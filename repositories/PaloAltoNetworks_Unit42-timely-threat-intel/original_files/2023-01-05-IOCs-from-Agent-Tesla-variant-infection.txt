REFERENCE:

- https://twitter.com/Unit42_Intel/status/1611379660029366273

INFECTION CHAIN:

- email --> attached .iso file --> contains .exe file --> .exe loads encoded binary --> binary decoded & used to generate Agent Telsa-style traffic

NOTES:

- This malware triggers alerts for Agent Tesla, but it is likely OriginLogger as discussed here: https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/originlogger/

- The malware EXE used for this infection rettrieves XOR-encoded binary from a web server.
- The XOR-encoded binary is decoded into a malicious DLL that is used to generate Agent Tesla-style traffic.
- The decoded DLL is not saved to disk.
- The infected host will start thise entire process again after the host is rebooted, or the victim logs off & logs back in.
