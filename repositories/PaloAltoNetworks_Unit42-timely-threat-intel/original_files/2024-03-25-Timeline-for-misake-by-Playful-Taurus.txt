NOTES:

- This post provides a timeline highlighting a C2 domain misspelled by a threat actor we track as Playful Taurus.  
- Additional information on Playful Taurus is available at https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/playful-taurus/.
- Our telemetry indicates Playful Taurus activity from 2023 targeting a client in the Middle East.
- An investigation revealed Turian malware we detected in October 2023 that we believe is from Playful Taurus:
  -- File path: C:\Windows\SysWOW64\appmgmt.dll
  -- Hash: 5d471822810e1633760863c98f8bcf2e0525c67ee0ea4b28fa11a22780e8ce9f
- We found the following C2 domain after extracting the malware configuration data:
  -- update.adobeonline[.]net
- Pivoting on this C2 domain reveals a likely mistake in naming the C2 domain in Playful Taurus malware from 2022.

TIMELINE:

2022-03-24: adobeonline[.]net registered through NameSilo.

2022-07-19: update.adobeonline[.]net resolves to 3.62.106[.]27. 
Based on our investigation, we believe this domain was used by Playful Taurus.

2022-07-03: Windows EXE 55b65177bfe12aee82e27f6de311649e4d643608bfb811bd7768e92a11c671dc submitted to VirusTotal. 
This Turian sample contacts update.adboeonline[.]net, a misspelled domain (adboeonline instead of adobeonline).

2022-07-08: Windows EXE f7671e43dd22264d534f3a211383f45d0359985a13ebed09dabb12e1384ec807 submitted to VirusTotal.
This Turian sample contacts update.adboeonline[.]net, a misspelled domain (adboeonline instead of adobeonline).

2022-07-19: Windows EXE bfb44ed70b5096b9884245af952b979241811e49ec96d1463bd9384c360e484e submitted to VirusTotal.
This Turian sample contacts update.adobeonline[.]net, the correctly-spelled domain we believe was used by Playful Taurus.

2023-01-19: adboeonline[.]net registered through NetOwl.
This intentional misspelling doesn't appear to be related to previous misspellings noted earlier in this timeline.

CONCLUSION:

Based on the above info, we believe Playful Taurus made a typo for the C2 domain in two Turian samples from 2022:

- 55b65177bfe12aee82e27f6de311649e4d643608bfb811bd7768e92a11c671dc
- f7671e43dd22264d534f3a211383f45d0359985a13ebed09dabb12e1384ec807

This indicates that even an advanced persistent threat (APT) group known for espionage like Playful Taurus can make mistakes.
