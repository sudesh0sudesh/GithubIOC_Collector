# Emotet
At the beginning of 2021, Emotet was considered to be the world's most dangerous malware by Europol. The threat was first discovered in 2014, when it was acting as a banking trojan. Over the years, the malware evolved into one of the most relevant botnets in the threat landscape, many times used to deliver other threats, such as Trickbot and Ryuk ransomware.
